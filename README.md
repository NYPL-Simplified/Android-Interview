3. Implement the Open Library API to search books by title.

### Acceptance Criteria

2. Books are shown in a RecyclerView

## How long do I have?

Please don't spend more than two hours on this project. Our goal is to get a picture of the way you approach problems; there will be more questions during the interview that will stem from this project.
How do I submit my assignment?


You don’t have to submit this assignment, but if you would like, fork this repo and provide a link to your work. During our interview, you will be asked to open the project and run it to demonstrate it compiles. Be prepared to share your screen.
